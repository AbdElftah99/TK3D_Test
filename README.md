# 🏗️ TK3D_Test

**TK3D_Test** is a demo application that showcases how to **automatically create architectural elements** using the **Revit API**.  
The project demonstrates modern development practices such as **MVVM architecture**, **WPF UI design**, and **Community Toolkit** integration — providing a structured and maintainable foundation for Revit-based automation tools.
